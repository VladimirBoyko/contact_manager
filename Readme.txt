   for example cd ~/Documents/Subjects_in_uni/DevOps_Tools/assesment_2/contact_manager

//due to assessment requirements, the build will have a FAILED status
// you might proceed to step 4 for the compiling
2. Compile and run tests:
   mvn clean test

3. Build the JAR file:
   mvn clean package

   This will create the file:
